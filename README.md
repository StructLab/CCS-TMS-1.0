# CCS/TMS Data Model

Welcome to the **CCS/TMS Data Model Repository**! This repository serves as an extension to the Transversal CCS central resources available on [Polarion](https://polarion.rail-research.europa.eu/polarion/#/project/SPT2TS/wiki/TCCS%20SD1%20-%20Data%20Model/TCCS%20SD1%20-%20Data%20Model_INFRA) for easy accessibility and collaboration. CCS/TMS is a comprehensive, harmonized framework developed to standardize data exchange and management within the European Railway System. This data model supports the digital transformation and interoperability needs of the railway sector by providing consistent data structures for traffic control, train management, and other rail-related applications.

## Overview

The **CCS/TMS Data Model** (Control Command and Signalling/Traffic Management System) is a standardized framework aimed at enabling seamless data exchange across railway systems. Developed under the ERJU Transversal CCS, this model specifies data structures that are critical for various railway functions such as engineering, asset management, operational plan, train protection, and automated train operations. For more information, see [CCS/TMS Data Model - Scope](https://polarion.rail-research.europa.eu/polarion/#/project/SPT2TS/wiki/30%20SD1%20Deliverables/CCS_TMS%20Data%20Model%20-%20Scope%20and%20Approach%20for%20Collaboration%20and%20Specification) 

### Key Features

- **Standardized Data Language**: Establishes a consistent language for data across CCS/TMS interfaces.
- **Comprehensive Engineering and Domain Data**: Covers both Engineering Data (base data, e.g., track topology and configuration) and Domain Data (use-case-specific data tailored for system functionalities).
- **Interoperability and Scalability**: Ensures compatibility across railway systems, facilitating a scalable approach for data-driven rail operations.
- **Interface Specification**: Specific Data Model which is directly used for data & interface specification.
- **ERA Vocabulary Alignment**: Integration and full alignment with the ERA vocabulary (ontology).

## Application of the Data Model

The CCS/TMS Data Model is applicable across multiple railway functions, including:

- **Traffic Control**: Standardized data structures enable efficient communication and control for automated and manual traffic management systems.
- **Asset Management**: The Engineering Data component supports infrastructure planning, configuration, and asset lifecycle management.
- **Automated Train Operations (ATO)**: Provides essential data support for ATO systems, enabling a higher level of automation and safety in railway operations.

## Collaboration and Development

This data model is developed in collaboration with various System Pillar domains and is continuously refined based on feedback and implementation experiences. The model integrates best practices from existing railway standards and harmonizes them for greater efficiency and functionality.
